# **Introduction to Linux**

### **The Boot Process**

The Linux boot process is the procedure for initializing the system. It consists of everything that happens from when the computer power is first switched on until the user interface is fully operational. 

Having a good understanding of the steps in the boot process may help you with troubleshooting problems, as well as with tailoring the computer's performance to your needs. 

On the other hand, the boot process can be rather technical, and you can start using Linux without knowing all the details. 

_**NOTE:** You may want to come back and study this section later, if you want to first get a good feel for how to use a Linux system._

### **BIOS - The First Step**

Starting an x86-based Linux system involves a number of steps. When the computer is powered on, the **B**asic **I**nput/**O**utput **S**ystem (**BIOS**) initializes the hardware, including the screen and keyboard, and tests the main memory. This process is also called **POST** (**P**ower **O**n **S**elf **T**est).

The BIOS software is stored on a ROM chip on the motherboard. After this, the remainder of the boot process is controlled by the operating system (OS).

### **Master Boot Record (MBR) and Boot Loader**

Once the POST is completed, the system control passes from the BIOS to the **boot loader**. The boot loader is usually stored on one of the hard disks in the system, either in the boot sector (for traditional BIOS/MBR systems) or the **EFI** partition (for more recent (Unified) **E**xtensible **F**irmware **I**nterface or **EFI/UEFI** systems). Up to this stage, the machine does not access any mass storage media. Thereafter, information on date, time, and the most important peripherals are loaded from the CMOS values (after a technology used for the battery-powered memory store which allows the system to keep track of the date and time even when it is powered off).

A number of boot loaders exist for Linux; the most common ones are **GRUB** (for **GR**and **U**nified **B**oot loader), **ISOLINUX** (for booting from removable media), and **DAS U-Boot** (for booting on embedded devices/appliances). Most Linux boot loaders can present a user interface for choosing alternative options for booting Linux, and even other operating systems that might be installed. When booting Linux, the boot loader is responsible for loading the kernel image and the initial RAM disk or filesystem (which contains some critical files and device drivers needed to start the system) into memory.

### **Boot Loader in Action**

The boot loader has two distinct stages:

For systems using the BIOS/MBR method, the boot loader resides at the first sector of the hard disk, also known as the **M**aster **B**oot **R**ecord (**MBR**). The size of the MBR is just 512 bytes. In this stage, the boot loader examines the **partition table** and finds a bootable partition. Once it finds a bootable partition, it then searches for the second stage boot loader, for example GRUB, and loads it into RAM (Random Access Memory). For systems using the EFI/UEFI method, UEFI firmware reads its Boot Manager data to determine which UEFI application is to be launched and from where (i.e. from which disk and partition the EFI partition can be found). The firmware then launches the UEFI application, for example GRUB, as defined in the boot entry in the firmware's boot manager. This procedure is more complicated, but more versatile than the older MBR methods.

The second stage boot loader resides under `/boot`. A splash screen is displayed, which allows us to choose which operating system (OS) to boot. After choosing the OS, the boot loader loads the kernel of the selected operating system into RAM and passes control to it. Kernels are almost always compressed, so its first job is to uncompress itself. After this, it will check and analyze the system hardware and initialize any hardware device drivers built into the kernel.

### **Initial RAM Disk**

The **initramfs** filesystem image contains programs and binary files that perform all actions needed to mount the proper root filesystem, like providing kernel functionality for the needed filesystem and device drivers for mass storage controllers with a facility called **udev** (for **u**ser **dev**ice), which is responsible for figuring out which devices are present, locating the device drivers they need to operate properly, and loading them. After the root filesystem has been found, it is checked for errors and mounted.

The **mount** program instructs the operating system that a filesystem is ready for use, and associates it with a particular point in the overall hierarchy of the filesystem (the **mount point**). If this is successful, the initramfs is cleared from RAM and the init program on the root filesystem (`/sbin/init`) is executed.

**init** handles the mounting and pivoting over to the final real root filesystem. If special hardware drivers are needed before the mass storage can be accessed, they must be in the initramfs image.

### **Text-Mode Login**

Near the end of the boot process, **init** starts a number of text-mode login prompts. These enable us to type our username, followed by our password, and to eventually get a command shell. However, if we are running a system with a graphical login interface, we will not see these at first.

The terminals which run the command shells can be accessed using the **ALT** key plus a `function` key. Most distributions start six text terminals and one graphics terminal starting with **F1** or **F2**. Within a graphical environment, switching to a text console requires pressing **CTRL-ALT** + the appropriate function key (with **F7** or **F1** leading to the GUI).

Usually, the default command shell is **bash** (the **GNU** **B**ourne **A**gain **Sh**ell), but there are a number of other advanced command shells available. The shell prints a text prompt, indicating it is ready to accept commands; after the user types the command and presses `Enter`, the command is executed, and another prompt is displayed after the command is done.

### **The Linux Kernel**

The boot loader loads both the **kernel** and an initial RAM–based file system (initramfs) into memory, so it can be used directly by the kernel.

When the kernel is loaded in RAM, it immediately initializes and configures the computer’s memory and also configures all the hardware attached to the system. This includes all processors, I/O subsystems, storage devices, etc. The kernel also loads some necessary user space applications.

### **/sbin/init and Services**

Once the kernel has set up all its hardware and mounted the root filesystem, the kernel runs `/sbin/init`. This then becomes the initial process, which then starts other processes to get the system running. Most other processes on the system trace their origin ultimately to **init**; exceptions include the so-called kernel processes. These are started by the kernel directly, and their job is to manage internal operating system details.

Besides starting the system, **init** is responsible for keeping the system running and for shutting it down cleanly. One of its responsibilities is to act when necessary as a manager for all non-kernel processes; it cleans up after them upon completion, and restarts user login services as needed when users log in and out, and does the same for other background system services.

Traditionally, this process startup was done using conventions that date back to the 1980s and the System V variety of UNIX. This serial process had the system passing through a sequence of **runlevels** containing collections of scripts that start and stop services. Each runlevel supported a different mode of running the system. Within each runlevel, individual services could be set to run, or to be shut down if running.

However, all major distributions have moved away from this sequential runlevel method of system initialization, although they usually emulate many System V utilities for compatibility purposes. Next, we discuss the new methods, of which **systemd** has become dominant.
